	is that the sum and difference patterns are synthesized with the

	In addition, it is of interest to maximize the slope of the difference
	pattern at boresight since the slope is directly related to tracking
	accuracy. Accordingly, various difference patterns are presented
	and the maximum slope determined. The parameters considered include

	Extensions to pores of arbitrary orientation and cross-section are
	achieved by introducing physically-measura ble microstructural constants
	rather than phenomenological bulk parameters that might be frequency
	dependent. By comparison of several theories that account for sound
	propagation within an elastically-framed porous material a basis
	is laid for an improved formulation, that takes into account both
	viscosity and heat conduction. The application of various propagation
	theories to model the reflection and transmission of sound at porous
	boundaries is considered. Particular attention is paid to the common
	assumption of local reaction and to the adequacy of modelling the
	porous interface as that of a quasi-homogeneous fluid. Finally the
	most widely used methods of measuring acoustical characteristics
	of porous materials at normal and oblique incidence and of obtaining
	their values by empirical means are surveyed.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present an approach for processing of sonar signals
	with the ultimate goal of ocean bottom sediment classification. Work
	reported is based on sonar data collected by the volume search sonar
	(VSS) in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as on VSS synthetic data. The
	volume search sonar is a beam formed multibeam sonar system with
	27 fore and 27 aft beams, covering almost the entire water volume
	(from above horizontal, through vertical, back to above horizontal).
	Our investigation is focused on the bottom-return signals since we
	are interested in determination of the impulse response of the ocean
	bottom floor. The bottom-return signal is the convolution between
	the impulse response of the bottom floor and the transmitted sonar
	chirp signal. The method developed here is based on fractional Fourier
	transform, a fundamental tool for signal processing and optical information
	processing. Fractional Fourier transform is a generalization of the
	classical Fourier transform. The traditional Fourier transform decomposes
	signal by sinusoids whereas Fractional Fourier transform corresponds
	to expressing the signal in terms of an orthonormal basis formed
	by chirps. In recent years, interest in and use of time-frequency
	tools have increased and become more suitable for sonar applications.
	The fractional Fourier transform requires finding the optimum order
	of the transform that can be estimated based on the properties of
	the chirp signal. The bottom impulse response is given by the magnitude
	of the fractional Fourier transform applied to the bottom return
	signal. The technique used in this work has been tested both on synthetic
	data and real sonar data collected by the VSS. The synthetic sonar
	return signal has been generated by the convolution between the Green
	function, which has been utilized to simulate the impulse response
	of the seafloor and the transmitted VSS chirp. A study is carried
	out to compare the performance of our method to a conventional method
	based on deco- - nvolution in the frequency domain (using standard
	Fourier transform). The amplitude and shape of an acoustic signal
	reflected from the sea floor is determined mainly by the seabottom
	roughness, the density difference between water and the sea floor,
	and reverberation within the substrate. Since the distribution of
	seafloor types is a very important tool in different applications,
	a sediment classification has been implemented based on a statistical
	analysis of the obtained impulse response. In order to perform a
	robust analysis of the signal, a joint time-frequency analysis is
	necessary. In this paper the analysis has been evaluated using the
	Wigner distribution, which can be thought of as a signal energy distribution
	in joint time-frequency domain. Singular value decomposition of the
	Wigner distribution has been used in order to perform the seafloor
	sediment classification. A comparative analysis of the experimental
	results for classical deconvolution and fractional Fourier method
	is presented. Results are shown and suggestions for future work are
	provided},

  abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of a bathymetric synthetic
	aperture sonar and presents imagery from preliminary sea trials of
	the sonar. The sonar is designed for high resolution seafloor imaging
	in a shallow water environment. To estimate seafloor topology, the
	sonar ssytem uses the phase difference between elements of a vertical
	hydrophone array. Since the interferometric process uses a phase
	difference between vertically separated receivers, any roll motion
	of the sonar towfish produces a large error in the angle estimate.
	This paper shows how the phase errors due to roll of the sonar towfish
	can be estimated from the echo data and then corrected. A unique
	feature of the sonar is that it transmits two simultaneous frequency
	chirps in different frequency bands. This allows the ambiguity in
	the high frequency (100 kHz) phase estimates to be resolved using
	the low frequency (30 kHz) phase estimates. Preliminary results are
	presented from sea trials in shallow water (nominally 10 m) harbour
	environments showing the effects of towfish roll before and after
	compensation. Even in adverse sea conditions during trials in the
	Hauraki gulf, the roll compensation was found to work remarkably
	well. Bathymetric images are also shown of the changing seafloor
	depth across the channel in Lyttelton harbour and of objects proud
	of the seafloor.},

  abstract = { The design of a shallow-water synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) requires
	an understanding of key system and environmental issues. The main
	factors that limit SAS performance are as follows: micronavigation
	accuracy, where micronavigation is defined as the problem of estimating
	the acoustic path lengths to allow the focusing of the aperture;
	multipath effects; and target view angle changes. All of them can
	degrade shadow classification performance. Micronavigation accuracy
	is successfully addressed by the gyrostabilized displaced phase center
	antenna technique, which combines data-driven motion estimates with
	external attitude sensors. Multipath effects in shallow water are
	effectively countered by narrow vertical beams. Shadow blur induced
	by view angle changes is mitigated by increasing the center frequency,
	to reduce the SAS integration length while still maintaining the
	desired resolution and by designing the system with a minimum grazing
	angle of about 6 $^{circ}$ to reduce shadow length. The combination
	of these factors led to the choice of a 300-kHz center frequency
	and of a multipath mitigation scheme that uses multiple vertical
	beams. Experimental results obtained with a sonar incorporating these
	features have produced SAS images with 1.6 cm$,times,$ 5 cm resolution
	in range $times$ cross-range and shadow contrast in excess of 5 dB,
	at ranges of up to 170 m in 20 m of water. },

  abstract = {A correlation velocity log (CVL) is an acoustic navigation aid that
	estimates the velocity of a maritime vehicle using a transmitter
	and a receiving array. The CVL discussed here operates by calculating
	the correlation coefficient between the echoes from a pair of consecutive
	acoustic pulses transmitted towards the seafloor, across all combinations
	of receiver pairings in the array. A correlation surface is constructed
	by plotting the correlation coefficients versus the spatial separation
	vector of all the receiver pairings. The coordinates of the peak
	of this surface provide an estimate of the velocity vector of the
	vessel. However, the correlation coefficient surface exhibits high
	variance within a modest distance from the peak position, and individual
	datasets tend to be asymmetric about the peak position. Since each
	dataset consists of a sparsely sampled set of discrete measurements,
	the variance makes the task of peak estimation very challenging.
	This paper outlines the operating principles of CVLs and describes
	peak-finding techniques that are used to improve the accuracy and
	precision of the instrument. Three peak estimation techniques are
	considered, namely the highest point, and fitting of an axisymmetric
	quadratic model using either least squares or a nonlinear implementation
	of maximum likelihood estimation. It is shown that the maximum likelihood
	approach offers some advantages when the peak is controlled to lie
	near the centre of the receiver array, but the advantages are small
	compared to the additional computational load required.},

	sonar (SAS) imagery can be severe. Time-domain beamforming SAS reconstruction
	is able to compensate arbitrary track errors, but the more efficient
	frequency-domain reconstruction algorithms, such as the range-Doppler,
	chirp-scaling, and wave number (aka range migration or Stolt-mapping)
	algorithms do not allow for simple compensation, especially for widebeam
	sonars. Data processed via these block algorithms is usually compensated
	before azimuth compression in a computationally inexpensive preprocessing
	step. Unfortunately, this compensation assumes a narrowbeam geometry,
	causing blurring in high-resolution images collected with widebeam
	sonars. In this paper, we demonstrate a new technique for compensation
	of large, but known, motion errors in data collected with widebeam
	geometry sonars. The technique relies on obtaining angle-of-arrival
	information from the multiple-receiver array configuration typical
	in high-resolution SAS systems. The new method of compensating for
	motion errors was found to significantly outperform the previous
	techniques in a simulation of point-reflector imagery. },

	vehicle (AUV) that can be realized with commercially available components
	is described. The navigation system will be truly autonomous, requiring
	only a knowledge of the vehicle's initial position and attitude.
	The launch-and-forget requirement is shown to restrict navigation
	options to either an inertial navigation system or an arrangement
	using sonar-based two-axis speed-over-the-ground measurements (sonar
	velocity logging) and a heading reference device. Simple simulation
	modeling based on component accuracies shows that the sonar velocity
	logging method is a feasible proposition that will satisfy the navigation
	requirement. Commercially available sonar velocity logs operate on
	either a Doppler shift or a correlation principle. The merits of

  abstract = { The output of an array of sansors is considered to be a homogeneous
	random field. In this case there is a spectral representation for
	this field, similar to that for stationary random processes, which
	consists of a superposition of traveling waves. The frequency-wavenumber
	power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes
	of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis
	of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional
	method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation
	uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially
	by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method
	of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose
	shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate
	is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method
	is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application
	of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large
	aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana. In addition, the
	application of the high-resolution method to other areas, such as
	radar, sonar, and radio astronomy, is indicated.},

	ultrasound systems under wide-band operation. A fast algorithm, the
	threshold accepting, has been utilized to determine the element positions
	and weight coefficients of a linear array that generates a desired
	beam pattern. To reduce the computational burden in the optimization
	procedure, an efficient numerical routine for the beam pattern evaluation
	has been implemented. We address the optimization problem of both
	dense and sparse wideband arrays. In the first case, the goal is
	to minimize the side-lobe energy by varying the element weights;
	we compare the optimized beam pattern with that obtained with classical
	shading functions, showing that better results can be achieved with
	a wide-band optimization. We also consider the optimization of the
	layout (positions and weights) of a sparse linear array to achieve
	a desired beam pattern with a fixed or minimum number of array elements.
	The comparison of the proposed method with a narrow-band optimization
	algorithm is presented, showing that better performances (about -7
	dB further reduction of the side-lobe level) can be achieved with
	a wide-band sparse array optimization. Further numerical simulations
	are given, showing that the proposed method yields better results

	of multiple targets moving linearly in a three-dimensional (3-D)
	observation area contaminated by clutter. The measurements are limited
	to time differences of arrival (TDOAs) of short-duration acoustic
	emissions, or transients, generated by the targets. This problem
	can arise in situations where the level of continuous broadband target-related
	noise is very low. Owing to the fact that transient emissions are
	nonstationary and can have low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the corresponding
	TDOA measurement errors are usually non-Gaussian. Therefore, Gaussian
	mixture distributions are used to appropriately model these errors.
	An iterative maximum-likelihood optimization technique based on a
	modified deterministic annealing expectation-maximization (MDAEM)
	algorithm is applied to this problem. In each iteration, the algorithm
	uses a nonlinear least-squares (LS) technique in computing the motion
	parameters for each target. It generalizes the variance deflation
	method previously used for the initialization of target tracking
	algorithms and increases the possibility of attaining a globally
	optimal solution for random initial conditions. Simulation results
	are presented for several different numbers of targets, clutter densities,

  abstract = {Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) is an emerging technology for seafloor
	imaging, which has an appealing property of range- and frequency-independent
	spatial processing resolution. However, for a low-frequency SAS system
	operated in shallow water environments, there are often strong sea
	surface and bottom reflected multipath components that interfere

	hydrophone array, several spatial processing algorithms have been
	proposed for multipath reduction. Most of these algorithms, however,

	the conventional wideband robust Capon beamforming, to wideband multipath

	While the first issue has now reached a mature stage, the question
	of how to produce accurately focused images in real-time, without
	mainframe facilities, is still under debate. The recent introduction
	of general-purpose graphic processing units seems to be quite promising
	in this view, especially for the decreased per-core cost barrier
	and for the affordable programming complexity. The authors explain,
	in this work, the main computational features of a range-Doppler
	Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processor, trying to disclose the
	degree of parallelism in the operations at the light of the CUDA
	programming model. Given the extremely flexible structure of the
	Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) model, the authors show
	that the optimization of a SAR processing unit cannot reduce to an
	FFT optimization, although this is a quite extensively used kernel.
	Actually, it is noticeable that the most significant advantage is
	obtained in the range cell migration correction kernel where a complex
	interpolation stage is performed very efficiently exploiting the
	SIMT model. Performance show that, using a single Nvidia Tesla-C1060

	Also, knowledge of how certain types of motion affect a SAS image
	can reduce the time spent in troubleshooting motion estimation and
	compensation schemes. In the field of spotlight-mode synthetic aperture
	radar (SAR), the effects of phase errors across the synthetic aperture

	counterpart problem for the stripmap mode is less well developed

	phase errors on stripmap imagery and shows that, under certain conditions,
	they are similar to those for spotlight mode processing. },

  abstract = {A three-antenna synthetic aperture radar interferometer (InSAR) with
	a statistically optimal data processor for three-dimensional (3-D)
	terrain mapping has been proposed recently to reduce the phase ambiguity
	and data-noise drawbacks of the conventional two-antenna SAR interferometry
	technique. In this paper, a numerical simulator is developed to assess
	the achievable performance and various design tradeoffs of the three-antenna
	InSAR. The most critical conditions for the new reduced-ambiguity
	system operating on realistic scenes are taken into account. The
	phase-unwrapping procedure is included in the simulator to compare
	the new and the conventional technique in terms of both phase and
	height-estimation accuracy. The performance achievable by a three-antenna
	airborne InSAR system on a given site are analyzed, and the parameter
	optimization of the new system is investigated. The results of several
	case studies show that the new technique can outperform the conventional
	one significantly for a typical airborne configuration, especially
	for high-terrain steepness. It provides reduced-phase aliasing and
	better estimation accuracy. So, the phase unwrapping is simplified
	and high-quality maps of terrain height can be obtained. As a limit,
	absolute phase retrieval can be achieved with good accuracy and the

	constraints. It is shown that a simple scaling of the projection
	of tentative weights, in the subspace orthogonal to the linear constraints,
	can be used to satisfy the quadratic inequality constraint. Moreover,
	this scaling is equivalent to a projection onto the quadratic constraint
	boundary so that the usual favorable properties of projection algorithms
	apply. This leads to a simple, effective, robust adaptive beamforming
	algorithm in which all constraints are satisfied exactly at each
	step and roundoff errors do not accumulate. The algorithm is then
	extended to the case of a more general quadratic constraint.},

	averaged. The estimate of the source bearing is the arctan of the
	ratio of the pair of products; the quadrant of the target bearing
	may be deduced from the signs of the numerator and denominator. In
	this paper, both numerical simulation and mathematical modelling
	are used to study the performance of such a bearing estimator. For
	large time-bandwidth products, the bearing estimate approximates
	a Gaussian random variable. As the time-bandwidth product is decreased,
	the probability density function begins to deviate significantly
	from Normality, and, at very small time-bandwidth products, the density
	becomes bimodal with an additional peak displaced by180degfrom the
	actual source direction. The performance of the estimator is presented

  abstract = { Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) imaging algorithms assume a specific
	ping-to-ping phase relation in the collected data. The line-of-sight
	signal from a nonmoving object adds coherently from ping to ping
	in the image reconstruction process while any random multipath reflections
	or backscatter from the sea surface may add noncoherently, thus improving
	the image signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). To move towards understanding
	just how effective a SAS is at suppressing surface multipath contributions,
	it is necessary to model the moving surface in a believable way and
	establish how the sound reflects from the undersurface of the sea.
	This paper presents a method for simulating the effects of multipath
	propagation on sonar data and hence evaluating the SCR improvement
	realized with synthetic aperture processing. This paper first reviews
	the Pierson--Moskowitz and cos-2s surface-wave spectra, which together
	account for wind direction, wind speed, and angular spread of the
	wave propagation direction. From these spectra a statistically appropriate
	random wave surface is generated which evolves in both time and space.
	In a first attempt to model the sea-surface multipath problem, a
	set of impulse responses are generated from this wave surface as
	it evolves in time increments equal to the pulse repetition period.
	Two sea-surface scattering mechanisms are used in the simulations
	described in this paper. In the first, each surface facet reflects
	as a diffraction-limited radiating aperture and in the second, each
	facet reflects as an incoherent Lambertian scatterer. These describe
	two limiting situations: first, the acoustic wavelength is small
	compared with the roughness of the sea surface; and second, the acoustic
	wavelength is significant in proportion to the surface roughness.
	The effect of surface multipath is shown on raw data and also on
	processed SAS images. The calculation of the SCR as a function of
	sea state is also demonstrated. The SCR improvement seen with- SAS
	imaging is consistent with the hypothesis that surface multipath
	signals are fully incoherent from ping to ping. },

	functions and training data used in classifier design with application
	to sensing mine-like targets with a side-scan sonar. Automatic detection
	of mine-like targets using side-scan sonar imagery is complicated
	by the variability of the target, clutter, and background signatures.
	Specifically, the strong dependence of the data on environmental
	conditions vitiates the assumption that one may perform a priori
	algorithm training using separate side-scan sonar data collected
	previously. In this paper, a novel active-learning algorithm is developed
	based on kernel classifiers with the goal of enhancing detection/classification
	of mines without requiring an a priori training set. It is assumed
	that divers and/or unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) may be used
	to determine the binary labels (target/clutter) of a small number
	of signatures from a given side-scan collection. These sets of signatures
	and associated labels are then used to train a kernel-based algorithm
	with which the remaining side-scan signatures are classified. Information-theoretic
	concepts are used to adaptively construct the form of the kernel
	classifier and to determine which signatures and associated labels
	would be most informative in the context of algorithm training. Using
	measured side-looking sonar data, the authors demonstrate that the
	number of signatures for which labels are required (via diver/UUV)
	is often small relative to the total number of potential targets
	in a given image. This procedure designs the detection/classification
	algorithm on the observed data itself without requiring a priori
	training data and also allows adaptation as environmental conditions
	change.},

  abstract = { When an underwater object is insonified over a range of aspect angles,
	the signals that are backscattered from the object can be sampled
	in space and time by an array of sensors, which can form either a
	real or a synthetic aperture. The spatial information contained in
	the backscattered signals can be processed using inverse transform
	methods to form an image of the 2-D spatial distribution of the object's
	acoustic reflectivity function. The signal measurement space (or
	data space) defines a sector of the polar wave number spectrum that
	quantifies the variation with aspect angle of the spatial frequency
	components that contribute to the backscattered signal. The temporal
	bandwidth of the incident sonar pulse determines the radial extent
	of the sector, while the range of aspect angles over which the object
	is insonified defines the angular extent of the sector. Equivalently,
	the extent of the aperture that is formed by the sensor positions
	relative to the object determines the angular extent of the sector.
	This concept provides a generalized framework that unifies sonar
	imaging techniques such as reconstructive tomography (image reconstruction
	from projections), synthetic aperture sonar, and real aperture sidescan
	sonar. The difference in these techniques is simply due to the azimuthal
	angle subtended by the aperture of the sensing array, which is typically
	a fraction of a degree for a real aperture sonar, several degrees
	for a strip map synthetic aperture sonar, tens of degrees for a spotlight
	synthetic aperture sonar, and 360$^{circ}$ for a tomographic imaging
	sonar. Experimental results are presented for a real aperture sidescan
	sonar, a synthetic aperture sonar, and a tomographic sonar that demonstrate
	the development of an acoustic image from a single blurred point
	to a clearly identifiable object as- the azimuthal extent of the
	angle subtended by the sonar aperture is increased. },

	is very important for many applications. Conventional super-resolution
	approaches can only deal with signals with wideband and flat spectra.
	In this paper, we propose a novel super-resolution time delay estimation
	method that can treat signals with narrowband spectra. In our method,
	the time delay estimation is first transformed into the frequency
	domain, in which the problem is converted into the parameter estimation
	of sinusoidal signals with lowpass envelopes. Then a MUSIC-type algorithm
	taking account of the envelope variation is applied to achieve the
	super-resolution estimation. Time delay estimation in active and
	passive systems are considered. Simulation results confirm that the
	proposed estimators provide better performance than the classical
	correlation approach and the conventional MUSIC algorithm for separating
	closely spaced signals with narrowband spectra.},

  abstract = { A shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is important information
	for target recognition in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images.
	Synthetic aperture imaging causes a fundamental limitation to shadow
	clarity because the illuminator is moved during the data collection.
	This leads to a blend of echo and shadow, or geometrical fill-in
	in the shadow region. The fill-in is most dominant for widebeam synthetic
	aperture imaging systems. By treating the shadow as a moving target
	and compensating for the motion during the synthetic aperture imagery,
	we avoid the geometrical shadow fill-in. We show this to be equivalent
	to fixing the focus at the range of the shadow caster. This novel
	technique, referred to as fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) can
	be used directly as an imaging method on hydrophone data or as a
	postprocessing technique on the complex SAS image. We demonstrate
	the FFSE technique on simulated data and on real data from a rail-based
	SAS, and on two different SAS systems operated on a HUGIN autonomous
	underwater vehicle. },

	resolution and area coverage of better than one square kilometer
	per hour. This makes SAS an ideal sensor for detection and classification
	of small targets over large areas. Fully automated target analysis
	allows improved autonomy when using autonomous underwater vehicles
	(AUVs) and saves a tedious manual analysis in post-mission analysis.
	Recognition of small targets in sonar imagery is, however, a difficult
	task. SAS imagery preserves wavenumber information. This gives the
	possibility for extra products in addition to high resolution imagery.
	We propose a two-stage processing where regions of interest are generated
	from reduced resolution SAS imagery and subsequently post processed
	images are used to generate relevant target analysis information.
	In this paper, we concentrate on the types of information available
	and their significance rather than the choice of intermediate resolution
	and initial detection methods. The extra processing products discussed
	in this paper are target-enhanced images by autofocus, shadow-enhanced
	images by fixed focusing, multi-aspect images, frequency-selective
	information and 3D shape from interferometry. We show examples of
	each of the additional products using data collected by the HISAS
	1030 interferometric SAS carried by the HUGIN 1000-MR vehicle.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of a bathymetric synthetic
	aperture sonar and presents preliminary results from sea trials of
	the sonar. The sonar is designed for high resolution seafloor imaging
	in a shallow water environment. This is achieved through coherent
	summation of successive echo signals to synthesise an aperture many
	times longer than the towfish. Provided the motion of the towfish
	is accurately estimated and compensated, the application of aperture
	synthesis can result in a range independent resolution over the operating
	swath. While high resolution is desirable for high quality imagery,
	it is not always sufficient for the discrimination of targets of
	interest from general seafloor clutter. Therefore, we have attempted
	to use bathymetric techniques to discriminate targets from the seafloor
	on the basis of height. The sonar is configured to use an array of
	three vertically spaced hydrophones from which three independent
	synthetic aperture images are reconstructed. Using knowledge of the
	sonar geometry, the relative heights of the seafloor scatterers are
	estimated using the phase differences resulting from the slight range
	difference of a scatterer from each hydrophone. Preliminary results
	are presented from trials in a shallow water (nominally 16 m) harbour
	environments. Results are shown for two different frequency bands:
	the sonar transmits two simultaneous linear FM chirp signals; one
	covering the frequency band of 20-40 kHz and the other covering 90-110
	kHz. Due to the use of a neutrally-buoyant, high-drag towfish, reasonable
	reconstructed imagery is obtained without autofocusing at the low
	frequency range. However, autofocusing is required for the high frequency
	data even though the synthetic apertures are shorter.},

  abstract = {It is well known that the beam width of a linear equally spaced array
	changes with the frequency of the signal being received. This affects
	the bearing accuracy with which a target can be located and the resolution
	between two targets. Also, the assessment of the frequency spectrum
	of the target signal is distorted unless the target is exactly aligned
	with the main response axis of the array's beam. Systems which have
	constant beam width within the frequency band of the receiver enable
	the bearing of a target to be determined to a fixed accuracy with
	a constant resolution. They overcome the deficiencies associated
	with conventional arrays. This paper presents a review of four different
	methods of achieving constant beam width. It is shown that the homothetic
	replica array has a simple analytic solution and shows potential
	for applications requiring bandwidths greater than one octave. This
	is demonstrated in the design and implementation of a twenty element
	hydrophone array with a constant beam width from 400 Hz to 3200 Hz.
	The experimental results are in agreement with those predicted by
	computer simulations. The main contribution of this paper is to show
	that the SHA technique proposed in 1970 by Smith, Hixon and Au is
	still the optimum choice in a practical sonar array system},

	Our simulator uses a novel facet-based scattering model that incorporates
	widebeam effects, shadowing, and multiple scattering. Using our simulator,

	effects, multi-path scattering from the sea-surface, and reconstruction

  abstract = {This paper proposes a viable solution to the port security swimmer
	detection/identification problem using a broadband active sonar system
	with TCP/IP interface. Broadband active sonar, characterized by compressed
	pulse and wide-ranging spectral features, offers the ability to locate
	an underwater target accurately and classify it as a swimmer (diver)
	apart from fish or marine mammals, thus considerably reducing the
	false alarm rate compared with existing energy-based detection systems.
	Coupled with tracking algorithms, the fusion output detector can
	further reduce false alarms, allowing high-probability automatic
	alerts to security forces that can't continuously and consistently
	monitor this sector. Applications of conventional back-propagation
	algorithms or probabilistic neural networks in cooperation with track-based
	averaging technique show promising performance to this real-world
	classification problem. Several testing efforts conducted in both
	Alaska and Washington state waters have demonstrated the applicability
	of the technology and highlighted aspects of deployment around facilities
	such as ferry terminals and cruise ship docks for homeland security.},

	The time argument at which the correlator achieves a maximum is the

	processors of similar form. Under certain conditions the ML estimator
	is shown to be identical to one proposed by Hannan and Thomson [10]

	frequencies for which the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is highest
	and, simultaneously, to suppress the noise power. The same type of
	prefiltering is provided by the generalized Eckart filter, which
	maximizes the S/N ratio of the correlator output. For low S/N ratio,

	lack of stationarity of the impinging signals. The use of a large
	array of sensors allow us to perform the source localization by using
	the wavefront curvature. The analysis of the range estimates based
	on the wavefront curvature have been thoroughly performed by various
	authors but, to our knowledge, is restricted to the case of fixed
	sources. The study of the effects of source motion for range estimation
	(Section III) and source detection (Section V) constitutes an important
	part of this work. This study reveals that the array performance
	can be far from the expected values, especially for large array.
	Therefore, the robustness of a direct processing of the whole sensor
	array is very questionable. The computational burden constitutes
	another serious drawback of this (direct) approach. The use of partitioned
	processings (Sections IV and VI) seems thus quite promising even
	if (and perhaps because) it is not optimal so as to fulfil the computation
	cost and robustness requirements. The performance of such processings

	reduce sidelobe artifacts only at the expense of worsened mainlobe

	as a means of reducing sidelobe artifacts, while preserving mainlobe
	resolution. Although the algorithm has been shown to be effective
	in synthetic aperture radar (SAR), it is heuristically motivated
	and it has received somewhat limited analysis. In this paper, we
	show that SVA is a version of minimum-variance spectral estimation
	(MVSE). We then present a complete development of the four types
	of two-dimensional SVA for image reconstruction from partial Fourier
	data. We provide simulation results for various real-valued and complex-valued
	targets and point out some of the limitations of SVA. Performance
	measures are presented to help further evaluate the effectiveness

  abstract = {The phase difference principle is widely applied nowadays to sonar
	systems used for sea floor bathymetry. The apparent angle of a target
	point is obtained from the phase difference measured between two
	close receiving arrays. Here we study the influence of the phase
	difference estimation errors caused by the physical structure of
	the backscattered signals. It is shown that, under certain current
	conditions, beyond the commonly considered effects of additive external
	noise and baseline decorrelation, the processing may be affected
	by the shifting footprint effect: this is due to the fact that the
	two interferometer receivers get simultaneous echo contributions
	coming from slightly shifted seabed parts, which results in a degradation
	of the signal coherence and, hence, of the phase difference measurement.
	This geometrical effect is described analytically and checked with
	numerical simulations, both for square- and sine-shaped signal envelopes.
	Its relative influence depends on the geometrical configuration and
	receiver spacing; it may be prevalent in practical cases associated
	with bathymetric sonars. The cases of square and smooth signal envelopes
	are both considered. The measurements close to nadir, which are known
	to be especially difficult with interferometry systems, are addressed
	in particular.},

  abstract = { One of the most widely used underwater acoustic sensors in the world
	is the DIFAR sonobuoy, which consists of an omni-directional hydrophone
	and two dipole sensors oriented orthogonally. The directional information
	provided by the dipoles makes it possible to estimate the bearing
	to an underwater acoustic source. In this paper, the performance
	of an arctangent bearing estimator is examined for both sinusoidal
	and Gaussian signals in isotropic Gaussian noise. It is shown that

	times must be long enough to give accurate cross-spectral matrix
	(CSM) estimates, but short enough so that the dynamic behavior of
	the noise described by the CSM is captured. The dominant mode rejection
	(DMR) beamformer calculates adaptive weights based on a reduced rank
	CSM estimate, where the CSM estimate is formed with a subset of the
	largest eigenvalues and their eigenvectors. Since the largest eigenvalue/eigenvector

	The purpose of this study was to examine the DMR beamformer performance
	using a bottom-mounted horizontal line array in a shallow-water environment.
	The data were processed with a fully adaptive beamformer and the
	DMR beamformer. The DMR beamformer showed better performance than
	the fully adaptive beamformer when using arrays with larger numbers
	of hydrophones. Thus, in highly dynamic noise environments, the DMR
	beamformer may be a more appropriate implementation to use for passive
	sonar detection systems},

	sea which human operators can be trained to recognize. Because ISAR
	uses the ship's own varying angular motions (roll, pitch, and yaw)
	for cross-range resolution, the viewing aspect and cross-range scale
	factor are continually changing on time scales of a few seconds.
	This and other characteristics of ISAR imaging make the problem of
	automatic recognition of ISAR images quite distinct from the recognition
	of optical images. The nature of ISAR imaging of ships, and single-frame
	and multiple-frame techniques for segmentation, feature extraction,
	and classification are described. Results are shown which illustrate
	a capability for automatic recognition of ISAR ship imagery},

  abstract = { Sonar and radar systems not only detect targets but also localize
	them. The process of localization involves bearing and range estimation.
	These objectives of bearing and range estimation can be accomplished
	actively or passively, depending on the situation. In active sonar
	or radar systems, a pulsed signal is transmitted to the target and
	the echo is received at the receiver. The range of the target is
	determined from the time delay obtained from the echo. In passive
	sonar systems, the target is detected from acoustic signals emitted
	by the target, and it is localized using time delays obtained from
	received signals at spacially separated points. Several authors have
	calculated the variance of the time delay estimate in the neighborhood
	of true time delays and have presented their results in terms of
	coherence function and signal and noise autospectra. Here we analyze
	these derivations and show that they are the same for the case of
	low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We also address a practical problem
	with a target-generated wide-band signal and present the Cram{\'e}r-Rao
	lower bound on the variance of the time delay estimate as a function
	of commonly understood terms such as SNR, bandwidth, observation
	time, and center frequency of the band. The analysis shows that in
	the case of low SNR and when signal and noise autospectra are constants
	over the band or signal and noise autospectra fall off at the same
	rate, the minimum standard deviation of the time delay estimate varies
	inversely to the SNR, to the square root of the product of observation
	time and bandwidth, and to the center frequency (providedW^{2}/12
	fmin{0}max{2} ll 1, whereW= bandwidth andf_{0}= center frequency
	of the band). The only difference in the case of a high SNR is that
	the standard deviation varies inversely to the square root of the
	SNR, and all other parameter relationships are the same. We also
	address the effects of different signal and noise autospectral slopes
	on the variance of the time delay estimate in passive localization.},

	sounders with a linear receive-array. A fundamental limitation of
	the conventional beamformer is that the angular resolution depends
	upon the size of the receive-array. The use of subarray interferometry
	may increase the mapping resolution for oblique beams, but this method
	is not valid in the case of multiple scatterers. Therefore, it is
	interesting to examine how modern high-resolution beamformers work
	for multibeam echo sounders. Early research for this purpose, based
	on data simulation, showed promising results. The authors apply high-resolution
	beamformers to raw sonar data recorded at the receiver elements of
	Simrad EM3000 multibeam echo sounders. The estimation of spatial
	covariances plays an important role in high-resolution beamforming.
	A method to improve the estimation by subtracting noise covariances
	is applied. Among several beamformers they tested, MUSIC and ESPRIT
	gave the best results. Compared to the Fourier transform beamformer,
	high-resolution beamformers clearly improved the resolution. However,
	the noise level might also increase. It seems that a combined use
	of conventional and high-resolution beamforming may improve the sonar
	performance},

	domain to yield the spectral density estimates. The theory is worked
	out for an arbitrary ideal, linear, and time-invariant system which
	is driven by a stationary stochastic input and for an arbitrary window
	function. Specifically, the rectangular and Hanning windows are compared
	with each other and the theoretical results are verified experimentally
	to great accuracy by using electrical RC- and LRC-circuits and a
	true random noise generator (see later parts of this series of papers).

	methods, computation time also depends on the preset approximation
	error, which particularly affects azimuth sidelobe level. The paper
	provides an opportunity to review speed and accuracy estimates made
	in previous literature. However reduction in computation time is
	not the decisive advantage of these time-domain methods. The difference
	from the FFT-based methods lies in the flexibility with which nonlinear
	platform trajectories, wide swaths, wide bandwidths, and multielement
	sonar arrays can be handled. It is also straightforward to obtain

  abstract = { In synthetic aperture sonar (SAS), the platform position must be
	known sufficiently accurately for signals to be added coherently
	along the synthetic aperture. Often, the onboard navigation system
	is insufficiently accurate by itself, so corrections are needed.
	A well-known method is the displaced phase center antenna (DPCA)
	procedure for correcting platform position using seabed echoes. DPCA
	methods have the advantage of insensitivity to changing interference
	patterns, moving specular reflection, and changing occlusion, with
	aspect. However, when seabed echoes are unusable, either because
	they are too weak, or because they are corrupted by multipath, the
	seabed DCPA method may fail. Therefore, we present an alternative
	DPCA method using sonar echoes from a suitable navigation fix, based
	on an object detected after standard beamforming. In our proposed
	system, look angle is obtained by tracking the centroid of the rectified
	image of the fix object. When the standard DPCA correction equations
	are modified for a fixed reflector, it turns out that they provide
	incremental range and look-angle errors, precisely the values required
	when the target itself is used as the navigation fix. Moreover, the
	values obtained are then self-compensating for errors in estimating
	seabed depth or forward motion of the platform. The navigation fix
	is selected by bracketing in range, and beamforming overlapping subsets
	of the receiver array. In this paper, we present experimental results
	at transmitter frequencies of 25 and 100 kHz where our method enabled
	well-focused SAS images to be generated with little recourse to other
	navigation information. Hence, SAS can be carried out, even when
	a sophisticated inertial navigation system (INS) is not available.

	authors on the statistical performance of the multiple signal characterization

	variance of estimation errors), in large samples. Next, it derives
	the covariance matrix of the ML estimator and presents detailed analytic
	studies of the statistical efficiency of MUSIC and ML estimators.

	The ML method (MLM) results from the application of the ML principle
	to the statistics of the observed raw data. The standard multiple
	signal classification (MUSIC) procedure, called MUSIC-1, is obtained
	as a brute-force approximation of the MLM. An improved MUSIC procedure,
	named MUSIC-2, is obtained by applying the ML principle to the statistics
	of certain linear combinations of the sample noise space eigenvectors.
	A procedure which compromises between the good performance of the
	MLM and the computational simplicity of MUSIC is a method of direction
	estimation (MODE-1) which is derived as a large sample realization
	of the MLM. A fifth method, called MODE-2, is obtained by using the
	ML principle on the statistics of certain linear combinations of
	the sample eigenvectors. MODE-2 is computationally less demanding
	than the MLM (it is of the same complexity as MODE-1) and statistically
	more efficient. A numerical comparison of these five DOA estimation
	methods is presented. It confirms the analytic results on their theoretical
	performance levels },

	scattered field for a time-dependent surface is obtained in the far
	zone of scattering in terms of the two-dimensional spectral amplitude
	of the surface and its dispersion relation. We develop a rigorous
	Delta;k radar theory and show that the nonzero output of a Delta;k
	radar occurs only when the Bragg condition for each signal component
	is satisfied separately. The frequency correlation function of the
	scattered field is then proportional to the mean value of the product
	of the spectral amplitudes of the surface at the corresponding Bragg
	wavenumbers. The mean value of this product is nonzero only for surfaces
	that have a locally varying spectrum and is proportional to the Fourier
	transform (with the argument Delta;k) of the variation of the local
	spectrum with respect to the pattern position. Such variations may
	be caused by either amplitude or phase modulation of the surface
	structure. In the former case, our results are similar to the results

	3-D acoustic imaging system based on a sparse planar array of sensors,
	which is particularly intended for underwater applications, are presented.
	Critical issues in the development of high-resolution 3-D sonar systems
	are 1) the cost of hardware, which is associated with the huge number
	of sensors that compose the planar array, and 2) the computational
	burden of processing the signals that were gathered. Here, such problems
	are overcome by the optimized synthesis of an aperiodic sparse array
	that allows the device to operate at different frequencies, yielding
	an acceptable sidelobe level and a good tradeoff between the field
	of view and the resolution. The array optimization is performed using
	an efficient stochastic method, in which the number of sensors is
	minimized, whereas their positions and weights are simultaneously
	optimized. To test the validity of the designed system, the signals
	that the sparse array received in response to the insonification
	of a scene with a wideband pulse are simulated, and voxel-based beamforming
	is applied to generate the 3-D image. The obtained images show high
	fidelity to the geometrical characteristics of the scene, in accordance
	with the expected performance of the 3-D sonar system.},

  abstract  = {A macroscopic theory of interference and diffraction of light in stationary
	fields produced by finite sources which emit light within a finite
	spectral range is formulated. It is shown that a generalized Huygens
	principle may be obtained for such fields, which involves only observable
	quantities. The generalized Huygens principle expresses the intensity
	at a typical point of the field in terms of an integral taken twice
	independently over an arbitrary surface, the integral involving the
	intensity distribution over the surface and the values of a certain
	correlation factor, which is found to be the 'degree of coherence'
	previously introduced by Zernike. Next it is shown that under fairly
	general conditions, this correlation factor is essentially the normalized
	integral over the source of the Fourier (frequency) transform of
	the spectral intensity function of the source, and that it may be
	determined from simple interference experiments. Further, it is shown
	that in regions where geometrical optics is a valid approximation,
	the coherence factor itself then obeys a simple geometrical law of
	propagation. Several results on partially coherent fields, established
	previously by Van Cittert, Zernike, Hopkins and Rogers, follow as
	special cases from these theorems. The results have a bearing on
	many optical problems and can also be applied in investigations concerned
	with other types of radiation.},

  abstract = { This paper provides the derivation of speckle reducing anisotropic
	diffusion (SRAD), a diffusion method tailored to ultrasonic and radar
	imaging applications. SRAD is the edge-sensitive diffusion for speckled
	images, in the same way that conventional anisotropic diffusion is
	the edge-sensitive diffusion for images corrupted with additive noise.
	We first show that the Lee and Frost filters can be cast as partial
	differential equations, and then we derive SRAD by allowing edge-sensitive
	anisotropic diffusion within this context. Just as the Lee (1980,
	1981, 1986) and Frost (1982) filters utilize the coefficient of variation
	in adaptive filtering, SRAD exploits the instantaneous coefficient
	of variation, which is shown to be a function of the local gradient
	magnitude and Laplacian operators. We validate the new algorithm
	using both synthetic and real linear scan ultrasonic imagery of the
	carotid artery. We also demonstrate the algorithm performance with
	real SAR data. The performance measures obtained by means of computer
	simulation of carotid artery images are compared with three existing
	speckle reduction schemes. In the presence of speckle noise, speckle
	reducing anisotropic diffusion excels over the traditional speckle
	removal filters and over the conventional anisotropic diffusion method
	in terms of mean preservation, variance reduction, and edge localization.},

	beamformer when multiple correlated interfering signals are present.
	Such signals may arise in certain multipath scenarios or in the case
	of smart jamming. Previous analyses considered only the case of single
	correlated interferer. Three scenarios of interest are examined:
	very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), moderately high SNR, and very
	low SNR. The analysis is based on simpler linear algebra concepts
	and generalizes a number of previously reported results proved for
	special cases. In addition, a modification of MVDR beamforming based
	on total least squares is introduced as a means of mitigating the
	sensitivity of the MVDR beamformer to uncertainties in element positions,
	pointing angle, etc},
