% *** SOME SELECTED PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}


\usepackage{amsmath}								% Use math symbols
\usepackage{amssymb}								% Defines symbols in AMS symbol fonts msam and msbm
\usepackage{commath}                                % Gives you \dif for the differential in an integral
\include{bib/dansMath}

\usepackage{cite}									% Improves normal latex citation mechanism when handling numeric citations

\usepackage{nicefrac}                               % Gives you the ability to make inline fractions
\usepackage{pdfsync}                                % Enables synchronization between text editor and pdf viewer
\usepackage{units}                                  % Proper typesetting of units

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
\graphicspath{{../output/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png,.eps}

\usepackage{epstopdf}								% Converts .eps figures to pdf format


% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Irttiable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifaceted syndrome with generally unknown etiology with few exceptions [pimentel cite].  It primarily manifests itself through one or more symptoms of chronic diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.  Generally, it is a diagnosis of exclusion after the patient has had a comprehensive workup. In this paper, we show how the author, the patient, who is a 34 year old male diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome  manifesting through symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea, utilizes a smartphone application and spreadhseet to track bowel movements, medication, exercise, and overall functionality to assess treatment efficacy.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
IBS is a multifacieted syndrom witih generally unknown etiology with the exception of the recent work done by Rao and Pimentel.  Generally, patients go through a battery of tests and eventually IBS is diagnosed as moreso an exclusion of other, more life threatening conditions such as chrons diease or ulcerative colitis.   Depits TODO of US population diagnosed with IBS, treating it difficult.  Doctors and have many approaches to treatment which include anti-spasodmoics, cognitive behaviour therepy (CBT), altered diet [FODMPA citatpion], SSRIs, and TCAs. Anecdotal, doctors and patients generally use a “try-and-see” approach for symptom managagment akin to contemperorary SSRI managment [TODO stard trial].

In this study, we seek to quantify symptom serverity, bowel habits, and medications in a lightweight manner making daily compliance of record keeping easy and regress on the data to determine what treatments are effective for an N=1 study, i.e. the author.  There has been much overlap between eitologies of anxiety and depression with IBS [TODO citation] so there is a strong need to have objective eidence to support a particlarly treatement especially because the placebo effect [TODO cite kirch work] may be large and the side effect profile of many IBS treatments may add to the treatment themselves [TODO cite side effects of nexium and librax.]

\section{Tracking Methodology}

The patient uses a simple android applicatoin and google spreadsheet for daily tracking.  The android applicaoitn used is Bowel Move and requires a handful of clicks to enter a BM.  Likewise, google spreadsheets are available on most internet connected platforms and smart phones making it easy to find a suitable computer to enter in daily data.  Together, compliance of the record keeping protocol exceeds 99%.

The patient keeps log of the following items through a google spreadsheet:

AM/PM health quality index (HQI)
Medication intake as dosage
Time spent performing cardiovascular exercise
Daily weight
HQI is defined on a 1-4 scale describing how the symptoms manifest themselves as a function of the patients ability to complete his daily wishes ans plans (e.g. work, exercise, time with family, etc).  HQI has defined levels which are:

Symptom severity requires medical urgent medical attention (e.g. ED visit)
Symptom severity prevents patient from completly daily wishes (e.g. missed a day of work due to persistant abdominal pain)
Symptoms notable but patient is able to cope with symptoms to complete daily wishes (e.g. a stomach ache while at a baseball game which is tolerable and resolves with time)
Symptoms are not present.
Medications are recorded as total daily dose.  For example, a daily dose of 20mg Nexium bid is entered as 40mg. Time spent performing cardio recorded as total daily time in minutes.  For example, a two-hour mountain bike ride is records as 120 minutes. Daily weight is recorded first thing in the morning and entered in pounds.

The Bowel Move records the following:

Time of movement
Bristol Stool Score (BSS) [TODO cite] of movement.

\section{Analysis}

A total of TODO days of daily recorrds were recorded which resulted in TODO BMs recorded.  The recorded time period is January 1, 2017 to TODO.  An exploratory analysis of the data follows.

Mean HQI per week

\end{figure}

Number of abnormal BMs per week as a function of type where abnormal means outside of BSS 3-5 defining hard stools as BSS 1-2 and loose stools as BSS 6-7

    \caption{The along-track spatial coherence for a system with directional transmit and receive beams is best modeled using a Gaussian function}\label{fig:abnormal_bss_whisker}
\end{figure}

We perform ordinary least squares (OLS) regresion using the data above to assess how medications and cardio affect HQI and BSS means on two different scales, 3 days and 7 days.  Two different time scales are assessed allowing a degree of freedom for the treatments to reach therapeutic level when initiated and washout when discontinued.
